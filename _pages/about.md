Hey there, I'm Kasra Khalaj, a passionate individual navigating the realms of computer engineering and animation. Born in 2004, I call Iran University of Science and Technology my academic home, where I'm currently immersed in the fascinating world of Computer Engineering.

I have got this other side, a world where I morph into a junior animator, bringing characters to life and crafting scenes that tell stories. It's not just about the motion; I find joy in the details, intricacies of UV mapping, and the artistry of texture editing.

Currently working my way through the rigors of Computer Engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology, my creative pursuits extend beyond the academic corridors. I've etched my mark in the digital art realm, contributing to collaborative projects that showcase my innovative approach to animation and graphics.

Beyond the tech and art, I'm known for fostering a collaborative environment. Sharing knowledge and experiences is a passion of mine, creating a supportive community for both computer engineering peers and fellow animation enthusiasts.

As I navigate the intersection of technology and art, my journey is a constant exploration. Whether deep in the algorithms or breathing life into animated characters, I'm on a path marked by a harmonious blend of creativity and technical expertise. The future holds the promise of groundbreaking contributions in both the world of Computer Engineering and the captivating realm of animation.
