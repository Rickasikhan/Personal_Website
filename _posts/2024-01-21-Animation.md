With the coming of Unreal Engine 5, Unreal Engine stands out for cinematic productions like Space Marine 2 due to its unmatched real-time rendering capabilities. Unlike Maya and Blender, Unreal Engine allows for rapid iteration and dynamic lighting, providing a level of visual fidelity that is hard to achieve with traditional software. Its Blueprint visual scripting simplifies the integration of interactive elements, while robust virtual cinematography tools make scene choreography seamless. In comparison, Maya and Blender, though powerful in their domains, may require additional steps to match Unreal Engine's level of interactivity and real-time realism, establishing Unreal Engine as a superior choice for cinematic excellence.

However, it's important to note that while Unreal Engine is primarily designed for games, Maya and Blender have traditionally been tailored for animation and 3D modeling. Maya and Blender excel in providing detailed control over character animation, intricate modeling, and complex simulations, making them preferred choices for many animation and film production pipelines.

Unreal Engine's strength lies in its real-time capabilities and gaming-focused features, making it exceptionally well-suited for creating interactive and immersive experiences. Its cinematic prowess extends beyond games, often chosen for pre-rendered and real-time cinematics due to its advanced rendering and visual effects capabilities.

In summary, while Maya and Blender have a strong foundation in animation, Unreal Engine's versatility allows it to bridge the gap between game development and cinematic production, providing a compelling option for projects like Space Marine 2 that demand both cinematic quality and interactive elements.

this formula is constantly used by animators to create fluid animations.
$$ lerp(a,b,t)=a+(b−a)⋅t $$


Maya and Blender, leading 3D design software, empower users with scripting capabilities. Maya employs MEL (Maya Embedded Language), while Blender utilizes Python. These scripting languages enable users to automate tasks, create custom tools, and enhance efficiency in modeling, rigging, and animation. The integration of code in both Maya and Blender reflects their adaptability, allowing users to tailor the software to their specific needs and extend functionality beyond default capabilities.

an example of mel can be seen here:
{% highlight mel %}
// Create a cube in Maya
polyCube;

// Set the cube's translation values
setAttr "pCube1.translateX" 5;
setAttr "pCube1.translateY" 3;
setAttr "pCube1.translateZ" 2;
{% endhighlight %}
