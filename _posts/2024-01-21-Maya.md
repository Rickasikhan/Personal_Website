Autodesk is the company that develops and sells Maya, the 3D computer graphics software. Autodesk is a multinational software corporation that produces a wide range of design and engineering software for various industries, including architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and media and entertainment.

Autodesk acquired Maya from Alias Systems Corporation in 2005. Alias Systems Corporation was the original developer of Maya before being purchased by Autodesk. Since then, Autodesk has continued to develop and enhance Maya, making it one of the industry-standard software for 3D animation, modeling, simulation, and rendering.

some commands could only be done via code in the old maya. An example of how the old maya worked:

{% highlight mel %}

// Example MEL script to create a bouncing ball animation
int $numFrames = 120;  // Number of frames for the animation
float $bounceHeight = 5.0;  // Height of the bounce
float $bounceFrequency = 0.1;  // Frequency of the bounce

// Create a sphere (ball) in the scene
string $ball = polySphere()[0];

// Keyframe animation for the bouncing ball
for ($frame = 1; $frame <= $numFrames; $frame++) {
    // Calculate the Y position for the bounce using a sine function
    float $yPosition = $bounceHeight * abs(sin($bounceFrequency * $frame));

    // Set the translation of the ball at the current frame
    setKeyframe -at translateY -v $yPosition -t $frame $ball;
}

// Play the animation
playbackOptions -loop "continuous";
playbackOptions -animationStartTime 1 -min 1 -max $numFrames;
playbackOptions -animationEndTime $numFrames -max $numFrames;

playButtonForward;

{% endhighlight %}

here's an equation which is frequently used to check whether a certain dynamic is possible or not:

$$
E = (h^2k^2) / 2m
